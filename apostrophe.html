        <span id="semibold">So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a
        way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther
        into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be
        interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way
        about them.</span><br><br>
        One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings
        about and that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like
        about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the
        possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it
        very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One <span id="light">do
        without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time
        to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in
        to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it
        out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but
        inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it</span>  <span id="thin">appeal by its
        weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do
        find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come
        in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come
        in.</span>
