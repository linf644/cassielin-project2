        What does a <span id="commas">comma</span> do.<br /><br />

        I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without
        them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them.
        I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time I
        felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with
        them.<br /><br />

        As I say <span id="commas">commas</span> are servile and they have no
        life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing
        oneâ€™s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my
        own interest in what I am doing. A <span id="commas">comma</span> by
        helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes
        keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to
        me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do
        not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively
        degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt
        and what I meant.<br /><br />

        When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans,
        verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became
        a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs
        aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the
        whole of the active life of writing. <br /><br />

        Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always
        liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial
        clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can
        see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that
        <span id="commas">commas</span> would be degrading. Why if you want the
        pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive
        complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that
        simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see
        now why I feel about the <span id="commas">comma</span> as I did and as
        I do.<br /><br />
        Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I
        mean.<br /><br />
        When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut
        the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so
        anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is
        writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what
        does a <span id="commas">comma</span> do, a <span id="commas">comma</span> does nothing but make easy a thing that if you
        like it enough is easy enough without the <span id="commas">comma</span>. A long complicated
        sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it
        and the <span id="commas">comma</span>, well at the most a <span id="commas">comma</span> is a poor period that lets you
        stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to
        know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping
        altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well
        you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than
        another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that
        about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a <span id="commas">comma</span>. The
        longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the
        same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very
        more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking
        care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby
        enfeebling them by putting in a <span id="commas">comma</span>.
