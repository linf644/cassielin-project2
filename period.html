        What had periods to do with it <span id="periods">。</span> Inevitably
        no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had
        to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop
        sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods
        had to exist<span id="periods">。</span> Beside I had always like the
        look of periods and I liked what they did<span id="periods">。</span>
        Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing
        that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened
        as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I
        used them<span id="periods">。</span> I really never stopped using
        them<span id="periods">。</span><br />
        Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to
        commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately
        with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will
        read you a little of it<span id="periods">。</span> By the time I had
        written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me
        completely a life of their own<span id="periods">。</span> They could
        begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing
        with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one
        could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so
        they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in
        this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their
        own<span id="periods">。</span>They did not serve you in any servile way
        as commas and colons and semi-colons do<span id="periods">。</span> Yes
        you do feel what I mean<span id="periods">。</span><br />
        Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of
        their own a time of their own<span id="periods"></span> And that feeling
        that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite
        variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods
        so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them
        more than one had ever needed them<span id="periods">。</span>
